a)
after removing using std namespace;
The program threw several errors,
All of them were scope errors, namely:
    'string', 'cout', 'cin', 'endl', 'getline' was not declared in scope.

This means that the above functions, streams and data-types
belong to the std namespace and were no longer available after the change.

I preppended 'std::' to each instance of the above 
to explicity specify the scope of the same.



b)
in int Critter::getHunger()
I had removed Critter:: and the error stated that
'hunger' in Critter.cpp:19 was not declared in the scope.

This means that the scope of the function no longer contains 
the variables defined in the Critter class.

The change was reverted.
