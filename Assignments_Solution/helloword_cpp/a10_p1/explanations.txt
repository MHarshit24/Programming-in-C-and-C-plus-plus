a)
It is mandatory to use the namespace because the computer needs to know the definition of the code of functionalities.
For example, functionality such as, cout, endl, cin are used but they are not defined in the current scope, 
so the computer needs to know where to check, so the using namespaces std must be included.

b)
I used the preffix because when you define a member function outside of its class, you need to qualify it with the 
class name and scope resolution operator so the compiler knows that the definition belongs to the class.
